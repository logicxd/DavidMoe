My notes from [How to think like a programmer - lessons in problem solving](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2).

## 1. Understand

1. You understand a problem when you can **explain** it in plain English. If
you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it.

## 2. Plan

1. Plan your solution. Write down the exact steps. 
2. Answer this question: "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return
output Y?".

## 3. Divide

1. Break problem into sub-problems. 
2. Solve each sub-problem one by one.
3. After solving each sub-problem, connect the dots.
4. Sub-problem doesn't just mean problems that can be broken down due to their
modularity. Sub-problem means try to reduce the problem to something simpler.

> too tough? What about finding the largest of just three numbers? Or the
> larger of two?

## 4. Stuck?

1. Happens to everyone. Take a deep breath.
2. The difference is better programmers are more curious about bugs/errors
than irritated.
3. Start anew. Delete everything and begin again with fresh eyes.
4. Research but look only for solutions to the sub-problems. Because you won't
have learned.

## 5. Practice

1. Try to solve at least one challenge every day.
