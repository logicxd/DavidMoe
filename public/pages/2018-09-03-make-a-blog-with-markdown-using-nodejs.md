This will be an easy-to-follow tutorial to show you how to add a blogging feature to your NodeJS website. This blog is was generated through methods that you'll see in this tutorial. Your blogs will be able to support: 
* Dynamic rendering of Markdowns to HTML upon server load. (Static generated HTMLs can be easily done once you understand how it works).
* Metadata for each of the Markdown.
* `Syntax highlighting`.

### Prerequisite
- You already have a NodeJS application set up.
- Basic knowledge of NodeJS.

### Adding Markdown Parser
This uses [Markdown](www.google.com) to generate HTML files from your Markdown pages.

### Obtaining Metadata

### Syntax Highlighting
