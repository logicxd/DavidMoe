This will be an easy-to-follow tutorial to show you how to add a blogging feature to your NodeJS website. This blog itself was generated through methods that you'll see in this tutorial. Your blogs will be able to support: 
* Dynamic rendering of Markdowns to HTML upon server load. (Statically generated HTMLs can be done easily once you understand how it works).
* Metadata for each of the Markdown.
* `Syntax highlighting`.

You can follow this guide by going section by section but they'll be written in a way so that you can just skip to whichever part you're already on.

### Prerequisite
- You already have a NodeJS application set up.
- Basic knowledge of NodeJS.

### Adding a Markdown Parser
We will use [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) to generate HTML files from your Markdown pages. It's super straight forward, you can look at the GitHub page itself to get it started. Here's what I did.

From the command line or terminal inside the project directory:
``` terminal
npm install markdown-it
```
