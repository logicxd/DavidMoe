I recently started my first full-time job as a software developer. There were
some things I realized that were different than what I had first thought about
a typical developer as well as some that never crossed my mind before. Even
though I had worked before as a part-time, I was juggling between my academics
and work so these things were never realized. So these are some of my experiences
I got while working at a company with about a thousand employees.

## Get Ready to Communicate

It's not that I hate communication, I really don't. To be able to walk over to
your co-worker's desk to talk and solve problems is part of the reason why I
left my previous job, which was going to be all remote work. But I didn't know
communication would be _so important_. Most of the tales I've heard about being
a programmer (mine included) was mostly being left alone to do your coding and
finish your tasks so this was surprising to me. Maybe I just wrongly assumed
that being left alone meant you don't communicate when you're just doing that
through chat or calls.

You have to do lots of explaining and detailing. There were many cases where I
would go over how the code works, how it was debugged, and what my thought
process was. My goal is to try to say only the bare minimum that they need in
order to understand what it is that they're looking for. Which also meant,
learning to control my urge to pick at every minor thing that I see and knowing
when I've said enough.

Listening and understanding other people's explanations. Just coming straight
out of college, most people I've had to work with were around my age and were
usually from the area. At work, you'll see talented people from all over the
world with different background and ethnicity. Which meant, they'll talk
differently, which is fine and is actually great. I think there's a lot to learn
from analyzing how they talk and good for the brain to work harder to understand
something that you're not used to.

You're going to be practicing public speaking skills. From standup meetings to
performing demos, you'll have to do public speaking. And as you get more and more
experienced, you'll be passing on the knowledge to others in the form of classes.
So if you're shy, like me, be ready to try to overcome your fears. It does get
better over time though.

If you want to work closely with the customers, you can try Software Consultant.
They work closely with the customers, getting the requirements, providing
suggestions, and demoing. You also have to talk with other developers on top of this,
Probably the most communicative job as an early to mid level developer.

## Being Prepared Before Asking for Help

Your co-workers and seniors are usually willing to help you. They _want_ to help
you. It's just that sometimes you may result to asking for help without trying
your best first.

After you figure it out without any help, ask seniors to help verify your work.

## Creating vs Maintaining Code

## Your Team is Not Just The Developers
