I recently started my first full-time job as a software developer. There were
some things I realized that were different than what I had first thought about
a typical developer as well as some that never crossed my mind before. Even
though I had worked before as a part-time, I was juggling between my academics
and work so these things were never realized. So these are some of my experiences
I got while working at a company with about a thousand employees.

## Get Ready to Communicate

It's not that I hate communication, I really don't. To be able to walk over to
your co-worker's desk to talk and solve problems is part of the reason why I
left my previous job, which was going to be all remote work. But I didn't know
communication would be _so important_. Most of the tales I've heard about being
a programmer (mine included) was mostly being left alone to do your coding and
finish your tasks so this was surprising to me. Maybe I just wrongly assumed
that being left alone meant you don't communicate when you're just doing that
through chat or calls.

You have to do lots of explaining and detailing. There were many cases where I
would go over how the code works, how it was debugged, and what my thought
process was. My goal is to try to say only the bare minimum that they need in
order to understand what it is that they're looking for. Which also meant,
learning to control my urge to pick at every minor thing that I see and knowing
when I've said enough.

Listening and understanding other people's explanations. Just coming straight
out of college, most people I've had to work with were around my age and were
usually from the area. At work, you'll see talented people from all over the
world with different background and ethnicity. Which meant, they'll talk
differently, which is fine and is actually great but it'll be hard in the beginning.
I think there's a lot to learn from analyzing how they talk and good for the brain
to work harder to understand something that you're not used to.

You're going to be practicing public speaking skills. From standup meetings to
performing demos, you'll have to do public speaking. And as you get more and more
experienced, you'll be passing on the knowledge to others in the form of classes.
So if you're shy, like me, be ready to try to overcome your fears. It does get
better over time though.

If you want to work closely with the customers, you can try Software Consultant.
They work closely with the customers, getting the requirements, providing
suggestions, and demoing. You also have to talk with other developers on top of this,
Probably the most communicative job as an early to mid level developer.

## Be Prepared Before Asking for Help

Your co-workers and seniors are usually willing to help you. They _want_ to help
you. It's just that sometimes it's easier to ask for help than trying your
best first. If your question is project-specific that only the people who have
worked in it may know, then it's no problem to ask. If it's problem solving, I try
to follow these steps:

1. Did I try solving it in at least 3 different ways?
2. Did I take a break and then come back to it?
3. What questions might my seniors ask and do I have answers for them?

Number 1 and 3 are self explanatory. They're just there to keep you thinking about
the problem. Number 2 because sometimes taking a break lets you see things a bit
differently. Kind of like how you would write an essay and you come back to it and
become amazed at how you wrote it.

After you figure it out without any help, ask seniors to help double check your work.
This step is probably the most important as this will introduce you to other ways
of problem solving that you may not have been aware of before.

## Developing New Code vs Maintaining Old Code

Developers at a company just starting off will do a lot of initial design process
and producing new code. Bigger companies usually already have products that have
been made and done so they'll be building on top of existing code to maintain them.

While both skills are essential, developing new code may be more rewarding for associate
developers. Developing new code will help with growth in the beginning but
then it'll start to get harder to improve. On the opposite side, maintaining old
code is harder to do in the beginning but you'll have a better knowledge after
getting through them.

Doing side projects can help you grow stronger in the weaker area. So if you're
doing a lot of development already, you can look into open source projects to contribute
to get you more practice. On the other hand, if you're already doing a lot of maintaining
code, you can develop some apps on the side.

## Your Team is Not Only The Developers

Most of the time, you'll be learning from your development team but there are a lot
of other things you can learn from other department as well. Seeing how testings
are done by the QA team will help you prevent bugs. Learning how the designs are
made will help you think about better UI/UX designs. One of the tips that I got
was to talk to the QA that will be responsible for checking
your work so you can catch them early and save time by having less back-and-forth
status updates.

## Continuing Your Education

I wasn't going to put this section here on this blog but I am going to do it because
of how critical this is. I knew that I would have to keep learning to keep up with
the new tech in the field but once you're out of school and you start working, it
seems like it's on a whole another level. It's not stressful as studying for exams,
but the way you learn and study your materials is changed.

You have to look for resources to learn from. I try to listen to podcasts, articles,
and my friends to learn new information. Because you're not getting the material
from your professors who are explaining it to you, it's up to you to make sure
that you test yourself and do your things right.

Know that you'll have to learn and experiment with different technology for the
rest of your life. It sounds like it's a lot of work and tiring but it shouldn't
feel too much like extra work if you enjoy the material. With computer science
being so diverse, I'm sure you'll be able to find something that you'd enjoy doing.
